//	Retail inflation is the average yearly increase in prices of common goods sold in
//	retail. For example, if the prices of common goods increase on an average by 10% in
//	a year, the retail inflation is said to be 10%.
//	Write a program that accepts the rate of retail inflation and number of years, and
//	prints the compounded inflation at the end of the specified number of years. For
//	example, if the retail inflation rate is specified as 20% and number of years as 5, the
//	compounded retail inflation at the end of 5 years will be 1.25 = 2.49 = 149%.
	
	//Not able to understand the problem  1.25 = 2.49 = 149%.
